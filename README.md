While developing my web application, I've been facing issues with the CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) policy. To work around this problem, I used the HTTP-server package, which allows me to serve my files locally and bypass CORS restrictions during development. This setup has helped me test my application without running into CORS-related issues. Another solution could be to use XAMPP which can also host my application locally and help manage CORS policies more effectively.

So Please first install: npm install -g http-server and within the src folder run  http-server -p 8000
